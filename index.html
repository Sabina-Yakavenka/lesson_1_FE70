                Gloomhaven is a game of Euro-inspired tactical combat in a persistent world of shifting motives. 
                Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills and their own reasons 
                for traveling to this dark corner of the world. Players must work together out of necessity to 
                clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process, they will enhance their abilities 
                with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story 
                fueled by the decisions they make...

                Pandemic Legacy is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24 sessions, 
                depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic Pandemic,
                in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, 
                treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand...

                Brass: Birmingham is an economic strategy game sequel to Martin Wallace' 2007 masterpiece, Brass. 
                Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, 
                between the years of 1770-1870.
                As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, 
                in an effort to exploit low or high market demands...
